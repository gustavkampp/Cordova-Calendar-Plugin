# Cordova Calendar plugin

This was forked from [Phonegap Calendar Plugin by Eddy Verbruggen](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin)

## Description

This fork is changed by adding the notes field to the `listEventsInRange` method.
The purpose is to make it possible to use notes field to hold an id of the original event in the remote system

## Credits

This plugin was enhanced for Plugman / PhoneGap Build by [Eddy Verbruggen](http://www.x-services.nl). I fixed some issues in the native code (mainly for iOS) and changed the JS-Native functions a little in order to make a universal JS API for both platforms.
